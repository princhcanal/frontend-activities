        Flexbox is one of the most useful tools in modern CSS. Flexbox makes it
        really easy to create the layouts that you want. Although it makes
        layouts easier, it's still tough to learn at first. I don't recommend
        doing all these exercises in one sitting. If you try to, you might not
        be able to process all the properties that flexbox provides. A lot of
        the exercises may seem really repetitive, but it is necessary in order
        to fully grasp flexbox. If you need more help in these exercises, I
        highly recommend checking out this article
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
          >here</a
        >. Also, I have one rule when doing these exercises:
        <span style="color: red"
          >DON'T USE MARGIN OR PADDING IN ANY OF THE GREEN BOXES.</span
        >
        This will force you to use the capabilities of flexbox instead. Good
        luck!

    <div class="exercise exercise-1" id="activity2-exercise-1">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 1: justify-content</h1>
        <p>
          justify-content is a powerful property in flexbox. It allows us to
          describe how the items inside a flex container is spaced out.
          justify-content manipulates this behavior on the main axis of the flex
          container. What is the 'main-axis'? The 'main-axis', by default, is
          pointing in the horizontal direction. This means that, by default,
          justify-content will manipulate the behavior of how elements in a flex
          container are spaced out horizontally. In this exercise, create a div
          that is set to display: flex. Inside that div, add three boxes like
          the ones below. Then, try and set the justify-content property on the
          outer div to the values below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h1 class="flex-container-title">justify-content: flex-start</h1>

        <div class="flex-container-row j-center">
          <div class="box"></div>
          <div class="box"></div>
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>

    <div class="exercise" id="activity2-exercise-2">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 2: align-items</h1>
        <p>
          Now we know how to manipulate the spacing between elements in a flex
          container horizontally, but what about vertically? Let's say our flex
          container has a height that is much larger than the elements inside.
          This is where the align-items property comes into play. It manipulates
          where elements should be placed in the 'cross-axis' which, by default,
          is pointing in the vertical direction. In this exercise, add some
          height to your flex container and try to manipulate where the items
          should be placed vertically like the ones below:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h1 class="flex-container-title">align-items: flex-start</h1>
        <div class="flex-container-row h-10 a-flex-start">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>

        <h1 class="flex-container-title">align-items: center</h1>
        <div class="flex-container-row h-10 a-center">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>

        <h1 class="flex-container-title">align-items: flex-end</h1>
        <div class="flex-container-row h-10 a-flex-end">
          <div class="box"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise" id="activity2-exercise-3">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">
          Exercise 3: justify-content: center and align-items: center
        </h1>
        <p>
          Putting both the justify-content and align-items property together, we
          can use it as a strategy to center an element both horizontally and
          vertically. Try to use the same container as in the previous exercise,
          and center the box in the flex container in both directions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="flex-container-row h-10 j-center a-center">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="exercise" id="activity2-exercise-4">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 4: flex-direction: column</h1>
        <p>
          I've mentioned before that by default the 'main-axis' points to the
          horizontal direction and the 'cross-axis' points to the vertical
          direction. With the flex-direction property, we can change that. The
          default value is row, so let's try to set it to column this time. Make
          sure to set the height of your flex container to something bigger in
          order to see its effect clearly. Then, try to apply the same
          justify-content and align-items properties as before, and it should
          turn out like the examples below. (Note: You can also set the
          flex-direction to row-reverse and column-reverse which will reverse
          the behavior of the justify-content and align-items properties)

        <p>
          Sometimes, you want the elements inside your flex container to be
          placed at the same spot, except for one. In order to achieve this, you
          can set the align-self property to one of the elements inside your
          flex-container to something different. In the example below, the
          elements are set to align-items: center on the flex container, but in
          the third box, I've set its align-self property to flex-start
        </p>

    <div class="exercise" id="activity2-exercise-6">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 6: flex-wrap: wrap</h1>
        <p>
          By default, a flex container will try to fit all of its elements
          inside one row (or column if flex-direction is set to column) and
          resize the elements if needed . If you want the elements that don't
          fit in the first row to wrap around and go to the next row, you can
          use the flex-wrap: wrap property. The first set of boxes below shows a
          flex container that doesn't have flex-wrap set to wrap while the
          second set of boxes has it set. In these boxes, set the flex-basis
          (the property to set the width of an element inside a flex-container)
          to something like 33% of the container so that only three should fit
          in one row. As you can see, without flex-wrap: wrap, the
          flex-container will just shrink the elements so that it fits in one
          row. With flex-wrap: wrap, the elements keep their original width and
          get sent to the next row if there is no more room.

    <div class="exercise" id="activity2-exercise-7">
      <div class="text">
        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 7: flex-grow</h1>
        <p>
          When you want some of the elements in your flex container to be bigger
          than the others, you can use the flex-grow property to manipulate a
          specific element's size compared to the other elements. How it works
          is that the elements that you set flex-grow on will share the
          remaining free space available in the main axis of your flex
          container. In the example below, one of the boxes has its flex-grow
          set to 1 while the other has it set to 2. This means that the free
          space will be split into three even pieces (because 1 + 2 = 3). Then,
          the box with flex-grow: 1 will get 1/3 of that space and the box with
          flex-grow: 2 will get 2/3 of that space. Similarly, if the flex-grow
          of the first box was set to 4 and the second set to 5, the first one
          would get 4/9 of the free space and the second one would get 5/9 of
          the free space

          Similar to flex-grow, flex-shrink can also manipulate the size of the
          elements inside your flex container. In this situation, the flex
          container is already filled with elements. In order to make one of the
          elements smaller, set its flex-shrink property to a number bigger than
          1 (because by default the flex-shrink property for all elements is 1).
          In the example below, flex-shrink is set to 5, which means that
          element will shrink 5 times faster than the other elements when the
          flex container is full.

        <h1 class="exercise-title">Exercise 9: order</h1>
        <p>
          You may want to switch the order in which the elements are placed in
          your flex container. You can do this by setting the order property on
          a specific element. Believe it or not, the elements below are actually
          written in the correct order in the HTML file (you can inspect element
          to see). By default, all the elements inside the flex container have
          their order set to 0. Setting an order higher than 0 will make that
          element appear after the other elements. This means that if you set
          the order of an element to 3, for example, it will not appear as the
          third item in the flex container. Instead, it will just be the last
          element in the container since it has the largest order compared to
          the other elements. In the example below, the box with 1 written
          inside has its order set to 2 while the box with 2 written inside has
          its order set to 1. (the box with 1 written inside appears after the
          box written with 2 inside because it has a higher order)

          This last exercise will put everything you've learned about flexbox to
          the test. If you're able to achieve this layout, I would say that you
          have a good understanding of how flexbox works.
